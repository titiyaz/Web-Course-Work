        <h2 id="plas_pollu">Plastic Pollution</h2>
        <img src="plasticpollution.jpg" alt="plas_pollu" height=350 width=260>
    
        <p>Plastic is a synthetic organic polymer made from petroleum with properties ideally suited for a wide variety of applications including: packaging, building and construction, household and sports equipment, vehicles, electronics and agriculture. Over 400 million tons of plastic are produced every year, half of which is used to create single-use items such as shopping bags, cups and straws. If discarded improperly, plastic waste can harm the environment and biodiversity.</p>
        <p>At least 14 million tons of plastic end up in the ocean every year. Plastic debris is currently the most abundant type of litter in the ocean, making up 80% of all marine debris found from surface waters to deep-sea sediments. Plastic is found on the shorelines of every continent, with more plastic waste found near popular tourist destinations and densely populated areas.</p>
        <p>The main sources of plastic debris found in the ocean are land-based, coming from urban and stormwater runoff, sewer overflows, littering, inadequate waste disposal and management, industrial activities, tyre abrasion, construction and illegal dumping. Ocean-based plastic pollution originates primarily from the fishing industry, nautical activities and aquaculture.</p>
        <p>Under the influence of solar UV radiation, wind, currents and other natural factors, plastic breaks down into small particles called microplastics (particles smaller than 5 mm) or nanoplastics (particles smaller than 100 nm). The small size makes them easy for marine life to ingest accidentally.</p>
        <p>Many countries lack the infrastructure to prevent plastic pollution such as: sanitary landfills; incineration facilities; recycling capacity and circular economy infrastructure; proper management and disposal of waste systems. This leads to ‘plastic leakage’ into rivers and the ocean. The legal and illegal global trade of plastic waste may also damage ecosystems, where waste management systems are not sufficient to contain plastic waste.</p>
        <p>The most visible impacts of plastic debris are the ingestion, suffocation and entanglement of hundreds of marine species. Marine wildlife such as seabirds, whales, fish and turtles mistake plastic waste for prey; most then die of starvation as their stomachs become filled with plastic. They also suffer from lacerations, infections, reduced ability to swim, and internal injuries. Floating plastics also help transport invasive marine species, thereby threatening marine biodiversity and the food web.</p>

        <h2 id="che_pollu">Chemical Pollution</h2>

        <p>Oceans are negatively impacted by oil from spills, discharge, and shipping. Major oil spills in oceans make headlines and are challenging to clean up.</p> 
        <p>Oil spills have been decreasing recently due to better technologies and regulations. A total of 1.1 million tons of oil were spilled in 1990. This decreased to approximately 25,000 tons by 2015, yet it still accounts for more than 10% of the oil that enters the oceans. The remaining oil waste is discharged into the ocean by rivers, drains, coastal activities, and shipping.</p>
        <p>Persistent, bio-accumulative, and toxic pollutants are the most hazardous types of pollutants. Even substances outlawed decades ago, such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), are still significant in deep-sea oceans.</p>
        <p>Polar bears, large fish, and other animals can have pollution levels in their bodies that are a million times higher than the water around them.</p>
        <p>Endocrine disruptors and teratogens, which affect marine species' capacity to reproduce or lower offspring survival rates, are a significant concern. Particularly cryptic compounds found in personal care products significantly impact ocean health. For instance, it has been discovered that the sunscreen chemical oxybenzone has a detrimental effect on coral health and reproduction.</p>
        <p>Nutrient pollution is also problematic for the environment, oceans, and human health. This kind of pollution occurs when human activities, particularly the application of fertilizer on farms, cause chemical runoff into waterways that eventually empty into the ocean.</p>
        <p>Algal blooms are encouraged by the elevated levels of chemicals in the coastal water, such as nitrogen and phosphorus, which can be hazardous to marine life.</p>
        <p>Algal blooms severely impact the ecosystem and human health, harming the local fishing and tourism sectors.</p>
        <p>Preventing pollution before it happens and cleaning up after it is a strategy to reduce chemical pollution. Today's civilization uses a lot of disposable and single-use plastic, including plastic bottles, shipping boxes, and shopping bags. The process of altering society's perspective on chemical consumption is necessary.</p>

        <h2 id="nosi_pollu">Noise Pollution</h2>
        <img src="noice1.png" alt="nosi_pollu" height=350 width=290>
    
        <p>Underwater noise interferes with the key life functions of marine mammals. It can have a variety of negative effects such as temporary or permanent hearing loss, behavioural and physiological changes, masking – the ability to detect sound being overlapped or covered by another sound, injury, and even death. </p>
        <p>Very loud sounds can truly harm marine mammals. If the animal is too close to the source of the sound, they panic and ascend too quickly to escape the noise. This has been known to cause decompression sickness, which can lead to tissue damage from gas bubble lesions. Loud man-made noises have also been linked to mass breaching events around the world. </p>
        <p>But the loudest underwater noise comes from naval sonar devices. This works similarly to echolocation, a type of sound used by whales and dolphins, and can travel hundreds of miles underwater. The risk military sonar poses to cetaceans first received international attention when there were mass strandings of beaked whales. Since then, attention has been drawn to other mass strandings coincident with the use of sonar and the list of species involved has increased. The number of strandings that have been recorded are likely to be a small percentage of what’s really happening as severely injured animals rarely make it to shore. 
            Loud noises can also cause immediate damage such as hearing loss and when sound is one of the main tools marine mammals use for survival in the ocean, this can prove fatal. </p>
        <p>A foreign sound can disrupt the natural behaviour of marine mammals. This is the most common impact of underwater noise and it can affect marine mammals in many different ways. They might move away from the noise, adjust their own activities to avoid the noisy times of day or even increase their anti-predatory behaviour. </p>
        <p>Sonar has been recorded to alter the feeding behaviour of endangered blue whales. In an experiment conducted in Southern California, blue whales were tagged to see how they responded to active sonar. Even though the sound levels were much lower than those of military sonars, the blue whales still stopped feeding, increased their swimming speed and moved away from the sound source. This can have significant impacts on the whales’ individual fitness, foraging ecology, and population health. </p>
        <p>Noise pollution can interfere with the detection of acoustic signals in the marine environment. This means that the sound we are creating in the ocean is masking the sounds produced by marine wildlife. This can lead to changes in individual and social behaviour, altered metabolisms and hampered population recruitment which in turn can affect the health and service functions of marine ecosystems. </p>
        <p>Noise pollution does not only decrease the communication range of marine mammals but it also causes them to change their vocal behaviour. For example, increased ship noise caused bottlenose dolphins to simplify their vocal calls. Higher dolphin whistle frequencies and a reduction in whistle complexity were recorded and it’s possible that this simplification may reduce the information content of their calls and therefore decrease effective communication. Marine mammals may also compensate for noise by making their signals longer, increasing the volume of their own calls, shifting their sound frequency or waiting to signal until the noise has gone. However, these changes can be costly. </p>
        <p>It is evident that noise pollution is having negative effects on many marine species. As they are already facing increasing pressures from climate change and overfishing, it is vital that we reduce our impacts where we can and as much as we can. To reduce anthropogenic noise in the marine environment, we need policies to reduce propeller noise from ships and people mitigating the sounds of sonar equipment, seismic air guns, pile driving and construction. We also need to develop quieter technologies; therein making it easier to reduce noise pollution.These actions can improve the ocean soundscape and potentially enable the recovery of some marine life. </p>
